        <p>One of my favorite hobbies are coding because coding is one of the main steps of making new types of technology. Also, it gives me a chance to use and gain creativity. If you didn't know, almost anything powered by electricity requires code. My brother Saumya and I are both coders and we are working on brackets,an IDE that works offline. I aspire to make a fully new IDE(Intergrated Development Enviroment) or differerent type of Microsoft so that children like me can be inspired by me and become even better than me.</p>
